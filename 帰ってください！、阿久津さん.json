  "description": "Ooyama-kun normally doesn’t get involved with Akutsu-san, a delinquent girl in his class, but for some reason she makes his house her hang-out place! Will she do something horrible to him behind closed doors or will he chase her out? But dealing with Akutsu-san’s sexy, cute behavior in such a confined space… he’s sure to get flustered! He wants her to go home, but he also doesn’t? A teasing comedy under a single roof!",
